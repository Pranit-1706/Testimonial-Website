        I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects that i learned were cuurent,if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny's worth.

        "I was an EMT for many years before i joined the bootstrap. I've been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best- and most grueling- time of my life. Since completing the course, I've successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup"

        Awesome teaching support from the TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from them and learning from their experiences was easy.

        "Before joing the bootcamp, I;ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and the staff did not dissapoint. They were very hands-on and i never had to wait for assistance. The agile team rpojet, in particular, was outstanding. it took my learning to the next level. in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've often referred to it during interviews as an example of my development experience. it certainly helpmed me land a job as a full-stack developer after erceiving multiple offers. 100% recommended!"
